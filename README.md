Libra is a dimensional analysis library based on [shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless), [spire](https://github.com/non/spire) and [singleton-ops](https://github.com/fthomas/singleton-ops).  It contains out of the box support for SI units for all numeric types.

Take a look at the [guide](https://to-ithaca.github.io/libra/) for what it is and how to use it.
